#Observations from the Linear regression model



1)Overall test accuracy is 78%. But it is not a good measure. The result is very high as there are lots of cases which are no left and the model has predicted most of them as no left.



2)The objective of the model is to indentify the people who will leave, so that the company can intervene and act.



3)This might be the case as the default model assumes people with more than 0.5 probability will not leave the company.




#Observations from Randomm forest


As per the model, the most important features which influence whether to leave the company,in descending order, are



1-satisfaction_level


2-time_spend_company


3-number_project


4-last_evaluation


5-average_montly_hours


6-work_accident

#Accuracy given by the models.

Linear regression-0.82

Decision Tree-0.9763

Random Forest-0.9846

It is evident from the accuracy, that Romdom Forest has way better accuracy than Linear regression and Decision Tree, so in the case of HR data set rondom Forest shows best fit.
